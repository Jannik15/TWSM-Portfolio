# TWSM-Portfolio
TWSM Miniproject by Jannik and Alexander
A miniproject in the course Technologies for Web and Social Media at the Medialogy bachelor in 6th semester.
It's a very simple CV that can be published as a website with hyperlinks.
The projects described were projects that either myself or my project partner Alexander had been part of in previous
semesters on the Medialogy bachelor.
